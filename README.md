## About

Milestone Project Four / Full Stack Frameworks with Django / Code Institute

This is a web application for a fictitious company called MBUA that has created a product called Unicorn Accelerator (UA). This particular site is focussed on allowing customers to:
- Report bugs (issues) discovered in the UA product as well as track their progress.
- Upvote issues. If someone sees a bug entered by another customer that they too have seen with the product, they can come in here and upvote the 
- Request for enhancements to the UA product. When they request a feature/enhancement, they must put in a monetary bid. If the enhancement is accepted by MBUA, the customer must fill out credit card details and payment has to be accepted via the payment provider Strip before MBUA will commence work on the enhancement. The idea is that MBUA will take on feature requests from the highest bidder.

This application is also used by the administrator at MBUA:
- Viewing, acknowledging and closing issues
- Viewing, accepting, denying, and marking features complete.

## UX Functionality and Navigation

#### UX
- The site is using one Google font:
1. **Montserrat**

- The primary colours are:
1. #4D7488 - all body text, a couple of h tags and active filter background
2. #007BFF (btn-primary) - Action buttons
3. #C4343B - Cancel buttons
4. #FFFFFF - button text

- Secondary colours:
1. #4EABDE - all links (except those in the copyright footer) and a couple of h tags

#### Functionality and Navigation

The site consists of the following pages:
1. Login
2. Registration
3. Profile
4. How it Works - this goes into detailed explanation as to how the application/site works. To that end, I am not going to put too much in here.
5. Landing Page - A brief overview here. Again, please see the "How it Works" page on the site for a detailed explanation. In short, this is the main dashboard page. It consists of 2 tabs: Issues and Features by

## Potential Enhancements

There is immense potential improvement to this site. Some that come to mind are:

- Sticky navbar. I tried and tried, but the way I have designed my navbar, I was getting bizarre behaviour. Normall I would work persevere but I am running out
of time to submit this project.
- Using different carousel images -- or rather, no carousel for smaller devices -- especially phones.
- A dynamic widget that appears as you scroll down the page that when clicked, will take you to the top
- Email behind the form. It is just a blank for for the sake of fulfilling the project requirements. Upon submission, it does pop up a modal thanking the visitor
for their interest in joining the gym.
- Blog and testimonials

#### Acknowledgements

- The Code Insititue! The tutors are always amazing, but were particularly helpful with this project. What 
made them really effective was there just would be some "chatting" between us and they would lead me to find 
the answer on my own. They acted like sounding boards. I really would like to single out Tim Nelson. I was 
working the weekends a lot on this and he was the one that was on duty. He knows his stuff, is patient, 
friendly and unbelievably encouraging.
