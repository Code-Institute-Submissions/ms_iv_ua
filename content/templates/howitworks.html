            <h3>Here's How to use the Unicorn Accelerator Dashboard</h3>
            <p>
                Unicorn Accelerator is the key for your organisation -- especially startups -- to make your product not only
                sublime, but takes you and your organisation down the path of success and riches!
            </p>
            <p>
                No software is bug free. Here at Unicorn Accelerator we understand that bugs can be very frustrating to you, 
                our valued customer. To that end, we provide a free bug fixing service. We like to be transparent which is one
                reason why the first page to our site is the dashboard of what has currently been reported and the status of
                various issues.
            </p>
            <p>
                There has been no successful software product that has had only a version 1! Our best marketing is you, our customer.
                To that end, on the main Unicorn Accelerator dashboard page you have the ability to request new features.

                                        If you have run into an issue with Unicorn Accelerator and are logged in, you may enter a new 
                                        issue by clicking on the "Report Issue" button on the "UA Issues" tab on the dashboard on the main
                                        page of our site. Note: that button remains disabled until you are logged in.

                                        Issues have 3 statuses:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Reported</li>

                                        When you first create an issue, it has a status of "Reported". Once someone at UA has
                                        seen the issue and acknowledged it, it then is promoted to "Ongoing" meaning we are working 
                                        on it. And finally, once we have fixed the issue, the status gets promoted to "Closed".

                                    <p>
                                        On the UA Issues page you have the ability to filter the issues that display. You have

                                        <strong>Requested</strong> is the status of the request when you first make the feature request. 
                                        When you request a feature you give it a title and then a detailed description. If we have more 
                                        questions about the feature, we will contact you via email and possibly set up a meeting if needed.
                                    </p>

                                        What is key about requesting a feature is the bidding process. Every feature that is requested must 
                                        have a bid (in GBP) associated with it. This bid is entered at time of entering the details about 
                                        the feature. The bid can be between &#163;10.00 and &#163;5000.00. In most cases UA will prioritise
                                        feature requests based on amount bid. Therefore, the higher the bid, the more likely it will get accepted.
                                    </p>

                                        Once we have accepted the feature, the feature status will be listed in the dashboard as 
                                        <strong>Accepted</strong> <span class="accepted-feature waiting-payment">with this</span>&nbsp;
                                        icon next to it.</span> At this point, you can click on that icon where it will take you to a page 
                                        to enter your credit card details.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Once the payment has been processed successfully, the status of the request will show as 
                                        <strong>Accepted</strong> <span class="accepted-feature working">with this</span> &nbsp;icon next to it.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Once the feature has been completed it will be promoted to a status of <strong>Finished</strong> and 
                                        automatically pushed out. We will notify you via email upon completion.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Requests will be <strong>Denied</strong> if the bids are too low and/or we have a many other requests at
                                        much higher bids.
                                    </p>
